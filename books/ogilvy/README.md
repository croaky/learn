This book was published in 1985
but is still considered one of best books on advertising.

## Goals

Good advertising doesn't make people admire your creativity,
it influences them to action.

Advertising should sell a product but
it can "un-sell" a product.
Consumers may not purchase a product **because** they saw an ad for it.

## Research-based ad creative

Author hates rules;
main thing is that campaign strategy should be based on strong research.

With that said:

* Describe what product does and who it is for.
* Develop an image and personality for brand.
* Position the product differently from all others.
* No dull writing.

Some ads are too complicated,
have too many conflicting goals,
and need to be simplified.

## Big idea

> It takes a big idea to attract the attention of consumers
> and get them to buy your product

[Counter-point from Seth Godin][seth]

> There's a difference between a big idea that comes from a product,
> and a big idea that comes from the world of advertising.
> The secret of big-time advertising during the 60s and 70s was the big idea.
> Today, the advertiser's big idea doesn't travel very well.
> Instead, the idea must be embedded into the experience of the product, itself.

## Reach

Ads can spread by word of mouth and influence culture.

Repeat the message that was successful.
Keep running working ads until they stop selling your product.

## Direct response advertising

Primetime TV advertising is more expensive and limited to 30s.
Late-night TV advertising often sells more products with 2m creative.

## Roles

* Copywriting is the most important role in advertising.
  Curious about the product, interesting prose for media, think visually.
* Art direction involves layout, psychology
* Researching involves statistics and psychology.

## Headlines

* Include the brand in headline if possible.
* Shorter better than longer.
* If location-specific, include name of city in headline.
* Puns and double meanings are not effective.

## Illustrations

* Remarkable idea, subject.
* Show after-effect of product use.
* Keep illustrations simple.
* Using well-known subjects helps recall.

## Body copy

* Only 5% of readers read body copy but can be large absolute numbers
  and those that do are most interested
* Address users 1-on-1, not en masse.
* Short words, short sentences, short paragraphs.
* What product will do for user, in specifics.
* Avoid analogies.
* Try to include price.
* Celebrity testimonials can be counter-productive.
  Users assume celebrity has been bought.
