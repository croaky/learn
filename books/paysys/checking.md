## Overview

The checking system:

* is "pull"
* has no o single owner;
  check clearing houses owned by banks or private processors
* is governed by U.S. law, network rules and Federal Reserve regulation
* economics are "clears at par"
* processes via intra-bank clearing by image or paper; batch
* manages risk by intermediaries and end parties

A check is considered a negotiable instrument.
It instructs a bank to pay funds out of a checking account
at a depository financial institutions
and provide those funds to the person or institution names on the check.

Checks can be transferred from one person to another.

Checks are a service provided by banks and other financial institutions
with regulatory permissions to operate checking accounts.

Although checking transactions begin with a piece of paper,
almost all of today's check processing is electronic.
This means the per-unit cost of checking is relatively low.

When a customer deposits a check,
their bank must collect the funds from the claimed account,
often at another bank.
This process is clearing and settlement
and happens bilaterally.

## Clearing Houses

In the 1700s and 1800s, messengers carried bags of checks between banks.
The cash or other instruments they received in exchange were subject to theft.

In the 1850s, the first check clearing house was established in NYC.
Banks joined the clearing house and brought deposited checks each day.
The clearing house facilitated exchange of checks
and calculated the daily net settlement for each bank.

Soon, similar clearing houses in other major cities were established
with schemes for inter-city exchange.

The Federal Reserve Bank system was formed in the early 1900s.
It required its member banks to accept checks "at par".
This meant that the deposit bank would credit its customer
with "100 cents on the dollar" rather than some lesser percentage.

If it had instead adopted a discounted (not par) clearing and settlement model,
it might have looked a lot like our interchange-based card payments system.
A merchant receiving a check for $100 might be credited $98
and the bank might keep $2 as profit on the transaction.

## Automation

In the 1950s and 1960s, magnetic ink character recognition
enabled high-speed processing of checks.
The bank and account the check is drawn on appears at the bottom of a check.

Check sorters, used by clearing houses and banks on both sides,
read the MICR line and slot the checks into bins.

Depository financial institutions developed a uniform bank numbering scheme:
the transit routing number assigned by the American Banking Association.

In the 1980s and 1990s, banks added cameras to their check sorters,
capturing an image of each check as it went through the machine.
This addressed problems of managing and storing the paper.

The Check Clearing of the 21st Century Act (Check 21) took effect in 2004.
The act was proposed and sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank. It said
that an image of the original is a legal equivalent of the original paper.

In 2010, the Fed announced that 99% of checks clearing through the Fed
were being processed electronically.

## Roles

It is the job of the bank of first deposit (the presenting bank)
to get the check to the check writer's bank (the paying bank).
The presenting bank will be credited by the paying bank upon presentation.

The check writer's bank offers its customers
a demand deposit account (DDA) with checking as a feature.
The bank might offer printed check stock
with the transit routing number and account number.

The check writer writes the check with payee, date, and amount.
They deliver the check to the recipient.

The recipient deposits the check where the recipient has a DDA.
Or, they endorse the check and give it to an intermediary
who then assumes the role of recipient of the check.

The deposit bank credits the customer's account
and makes the amount usable by the customer
according to its funds availability policy.
Their policy is constrained by Federal Reserve Bank Regulation CC,
which dictates the minimum availability for checks of different kinds.
Banks may compete on more generous availability terms.

This bank of first deposit must decide how to clear the check
(get the check to the check writer's bank).

Highly automated banks image checks at the point of deposit,
in the ATM or at the branch teller's window.

The bank then determines whether the check is presented under some form of
bilateral agreement with the paying bank, or clearing house,
or by conversion to ACH.
If converted to ACH, the check must conform with NACHA rules.

This deposit bank must then:

* Deliver the check image to the paying bank
* Ensure that IRDs (image replacement documents) are printed and delivered
  to paying banks that do not want to receive images
* Settle with the paying bank

A processor or clearing house may handle some or all of these tasks.

Checks, at times, now clear faster than ACH or cards.
The costs of transporting paper has been mostly eliminated.
A check can now be thought of as an up-front paper order to pay,
a kind of one-time payment card.

In the future, one possibility is immediate presentation of a check image
from an ATM to a paying bank. If the paying bank adopts real-time posting
(rather than waiting to post during a nightly batch run), then the deposit bank
would know immediately if a check bounces.

## Ownership

No single entity owns the checking payments system.
Each bank chooses how to support checking.

The regulatory framework for checking is U.S. law,
the Uniform Commercial Code.
It was published in the 1950s and adopted by all 50 states.

The Federal Reserve Bank issues regulations that implement checking law.

## Volume and Trends

The checking is system is large and decentralized,
which makes volumes hard to measure.

It is seeing a sharp decline in use in certain domains
such as point of sale payment and bill payment.

## Economics and Products

Banks offset costs from check processing with revenues from check products.

Banks offer consumers and small businesses
check writing and deposit capabilities
as part of bundled "checking account" products.
Writing or depositing individual checks is seldom separately priced.
Banks see check writing as essential for bringing deposits to the bank.

Non-sufficient funds fees have historically been
a significant source of bank revenue.

Small business accounts work the same way
and typically share the same delivery platform
but often have caps on the number of checks that can be written in a month,
with fees if exceeded.

Large businesses write many checks for payroll, benefits, and vendors.
Banks offer checking accounts with transaction fee schedules for them.

Unbanked consumers use check equivalents offered by non-banks.
Check cashing services allow consumers to cash checks
by endorsing the check over to the service.

Many small businesses write checks using accounting software packages
(for example, QuickBooks).

The bank or processor has operational expenses associated with
accepting and delivering paper checks, operating check sorters,
imaging and archiving checks, handling exceptions, fraud, and more.
Clearing houses have expenses associated with managing settlement.

Processors and clearing houses charge transaction fees to banks.

## Float

Float is a gap in the availability of funds transferred between two parties.

It beneficial for a party that holds funds before paying out.
It is costly for a party that pays out prior to receiving funds.

"Federal Reserve float" occurs when the Fed, as a check clearing house,
credits a deposit bank for funds received prior to collecting from paying bank.

"Disbursement float" occurs during the time between
when an organization mails a check
and the time the check is presented to its bank for payment.

A payments system that reduces float for parties lowers risk for those parties.

## Risk Management

Check fraud has a long and colorful history. Examples include
forged checks; forged signatures; altered amounts, dates, or payees;
and fraudulent endorsement.

Writing a check on insufficient funds (NSF) in an account
is technically fraud but seen as a different category of risk
as it may be accidental.

If the check writer's bank pays the check on insufficient funds,
the bank assumes risk of collecting the funds from the consumer
in exchange for revenue from the NSF fee.

If the check writer's bank "bounces" the check,
it is returned to the depository bank,
who debits its customer's account.
If the customer has drained the funds from the account,
that bank is at risk.

Retail merchants, billers, and enterprises are most exposed to NSF risk.
Industry estimates of annual losses are in the range of $10 billion.
Bank losses to NSF are not disclosed, smaller,
and acceptable given lucrative NSF fee revenue.

If a check is forged on a valid account
and the payee accepts it and deposits it,
someone is going to lose money on the fraud.
The check writer's bank has a legal obligation to pay an item
when it its "properly payable";
the check writer has a responsibility to exercise "ordinary care".
Bank exposure to check fraud is estimated at less than $1 billion annually.

Counterfeit checks are drawn on non-existent accounts.
Such checks become the responsibility of the depository bank,
which attempts to reclaim funds from the depositing customer's account.

High-resolution scanners and printers
have made it easier to forge checks on legitimate accounts.
Phished online banking credentials give fraudsters the chance to
see images of paid checks, providing a template.

## Risk Management Products

Retailers buy products for check verification and guarantees.

The banking industry collaborates on a database,
administered by Early Warning Services,
to help decide whether to accept a check for deposit and cashing.

Software is sold
that examines patterns of transactions within and across accounts
to detect transactions that might be:

* fraudulent
* in violation of money-laundering regulation

Software is sold that identifies fraudulent signatures and check forgeries.

## Major Providers

The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks (together, "the Fed")
plays these roles:

* Payments industry regulator by writing rules that govern practices
  by banks and other parties across payments systems
* Provider of payments services by operating largest check clearing houses,
  one of the two ACH switches, one of the two wire transfer systems (Fedwire),
  and as the sole provider of cash and currency to banks
* Manager of the National Settlement Service by settling for multiple
  private sector clearing houses

The Fed sponsored and championed the law passed as "Check 21".

The Clearing House, a bank-owned payments company, is a quiet powerhouse.
Established in 1853 as the New York Clearing House, it grew via merger.
It is owned by 24 large U.S. banks and U.S. branches of international banks.
It is a major competitor to the Fed in providing payments services to banks,
offering:

* check and image clearing
* ACH processing (the one other ACH operator)
* wire transfer processing (through CHIPS)

## Summary

Checking was long the dominant non-cash payments system in the U.S.
It is in decline but changes in check clearing have transformed its economics.
