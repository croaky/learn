## Consumer

What really matters in shaping consumer behavior around new ways to pay:

* Big increase in convenience
* Big perceived financial gains

Convenience instills confidence and inspires frequent use.
Any friction reduces consumer acceptance.

Financial gains have to be significant to matter to consumers.
Rich rewards programs have been successfully at developing loyalty.

Consumers say they care about security but
fail to adopt more secure solutions.

## Merchant

The fundamental job to be done is to get paid.

After that,
many payment product initiatives fail with
a value proposition of reducing merchant costs.
Many payment product initiatives succeed with
a value proposition of increasing merchant revenue.

Sell more:

* Acquire new customers
* Onboard customers faster
* Increase loyalty of existing customers
* Increase revenue from customers
* Increase speed of checkout
* Increase referrals

Rewards cards have been successful with consumers
but paid for by the card networks
by passing the cost along via higher merchant discount fees.

The point of sale environment is changing for merchants:

* EMV chip card terminals are rolling out,
  which also support contactless cards and NFC mobile payments
* NFC seems to be the winning technology for mobile payments
* Merchants are being offered a range of mobile marketing options,
  delivering coupons and offers for redemption at point of sale.
  These may take advantage of location-aware smartphones.
* Consumers might buy in-store, in-aisle from their phone,
  might use self-checkout.
* Mobile card acceptance programs (Square) have crept upmarket from
  the original micro-merchant users. Phones and tablets
  are increasingly being used for away-from-cash-register checkout.

## Biller

Billers include utility companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies,
and telecommunications and cable TV providers.

They are distinguished from merchant retailers due to delivery and
presentment of a bill to a customer.

Billers accept multiple payment options.

Consumers increasingly find bills more convenient to pay online.
Bills are often paid via:

* consumer's bank bill payment service or through the biller's website
* recurring deductions from checking accounts
* recurring charge to payment card
* sending checks in the mail

## Enterprise

Enterprises include businesses, non-profits, educational institutions, and
local governments and agencies.

There are more than 27 million enterprises in the U.S.
The vast majority have 20 or fewer employees.

They must control cash flow through scheduling payments.
Forecasting cash inflows and outflows is fundamental
to ensure ongoing solvency.

Very small enterprises manage payments similar to consumers,
often with the same bank used by the owner of the enterprise.

Medium-sized enterprises often use their credit bank for checking account
and add other payments providers as they scale,
such as payroll processor or a bank for regional requirements.

## Bank

One way to segment banks is how they target consumers for retail checking:

* Three national banks: Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo
* Tens of large regional banks: U.S. Bank, SunTrust
* Hundreds of small regional banks
* Thousands of community banks and credit unions

As banks have increased online and mobile capabilities,
"brick and mortar" locations have been eliminated.

In the U.S., to start a bank, you need a charter
from a state or federal chartering authority.
They examine the business plan, management competency, and capital adequacy.

The charter, when issued,
defines the capabilities of the bank.
The key activity is deposit taking.

A non-bank can lend money or handle payments,
but only a chartered institution can accept consumer deposits into an account.

Banks are audited and examined on an ongoing basis,
often by multiple regulatory agencies
who have the power to revoke the bank's charter.
Examples are the Federal Reserve Bank,
the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation),
the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency),
and the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau).

Banks make money by lending money,
holding money in deposit or investment accounts,
and moving money (payments).

All three activities are profitable but lending is most profitable.

Banks are technology savvy.
Online banking applications predated the Internet by more than 10 years.
The simplicity of the tasks
("check my balance", "pay the phone company $50")
are well-suited to automation.

Banks manage risk well,
and understand the relationship between risk and profit.

Banks' major products are the same as 50 years ago,
but how they are offered are different:
debit cards, ATMs, online, mobile.

Banks' customers tend to trust them but complain about fees.
This attitude led banks to introduce "free checking".

The payments business is "stickier" than the lending business.
Its revenue (e.g. interchange or float) is often invisible to
customers and therefore less likely to cause customer attitude problems.

Banks are frequently challenged by fintech competitors.

## Network

The three key functions of an open loop payments system are
rules, brand, and processing.
There is considerable overlap between "networks" and "processors":
many networks do some processing and
many processors operate transaction switches or own networks.

Most payment networks in the U.S. began life as bank-owned consortia.
Today, most are, or are owned by, public companies.

Most networks charge for their service on a fee per transaction basis,
which means they must operate at scale to cover
large fixed costs for operating switching and settlement platforms.
The global card networks also derive significant revenue from
cross-currency transactions from cardholders travelling internationally.

Networks tend to be volume-hungry but face a brand challenge:
a recognizable, positive brand helps grow volume but
can conflict with member banks' preferences for their brands to dominate.

The biggest power of a network is its rule-making authority.

## Processor

Whenever processes are outsourced to a third party,
that provider is referred to as a "processor".
They may provide processes such as:

* answering a customer support call
* determining fraud risk in real-time
* "on behalf of" transaction or account handling
* private switching services
* credit bureaus
* lockbox providers
* security and authentication services
* collections
* hardware for terminals and check sorters
* software for ACH and wire transfer

Transaction handling processing is almost always a fixed-fee business.
Large volume clients are usually low fee,
providing the necessary volume for the network but break-even economics.
Smaller clients pay higher prices and provide the profit.

## Payment Services Provider

Payment services providers serve end parties directly.
They may provide processes such as:

* check cashing
* bill payment
* prepaid card issuance
* money transfer (Western Union, MoneyGram)
* e-commerce (PayPal, Shopify)

They must invest in brand to reach end parties.

They may handle cross-border payments. To do so,
they establish a private network of correspondent banks to clear transactions.
Over time, they may develop significant "on-us" volumes
and can process these transactions internally
without relying on external banks or networks.
