## Overview

The wire transfer system:

* is "push"
* is owned by Fedwire (Federal Reserve Bank) and CHIPS (The Clearing House)
* is governed by network rules and Federal Reserve regulation
* economics are "clears at par"
* processes electronically in real-time
* manages risk in network and by intermediaries and end parties

Wire transfer carry the large-value transactions of U.S. payments systems.

Unlike other countries, the U.S. has two wire transfer systems:
Fedwire and CHIPS. SWIFT is not a payments system
but a global financial services message system,
frequently used with the large-value systems.

Most large-value systems worldwide have been modified in last 20 years
to become real-time gross settlement systems.
They don't use net settlement because it's necessary to avoid risks
associated with a potential bank failure.

Sender    ->  Sender's  ->  Wire transfer  ->  Receiver's  ->  Receiver
of funds  ->  bank      ->  network        ->  bank        ->  of funds
```

## Uses

Wire transfers are used for:

* time-critical payments
* fully guaranteed payments. They cannot be repudiated, reversed, or charged
  back without the agreement of the recipient.
* market transactions by banks and securities firms
* supplier payments by businesses
* real estate transactions by consumers

## Fedwire

Fedwire is available to banks with accounts at a Federal Reserve Bank.
It is a "super-sized" online banking service.

A sender sends an electronic message to its bank.
When bank is satisfied request is legitimate,
it debits the account and credit's account of receiving bank.
Receiving bank credits account of receiver.

This is all done with high degree of security,
such as encryption and token-based authentication devices.

## CHIPS

CHIPS is a private sector alternative to Fedwire.
It is owned by The Clearing House, which is owned by large banks in the U.S.

It is real-time, fully guaranteed, for large-value transactions.
CHIPS is not a gross settlement system.
It uses multi-lateral netting to manage settlement risk
while providing liquidity benefits.

## SWIFT

SWIFT is a global messaging network.
Banks and securities firms can send each other secure, structured messages.

An example message might instruct a financial institution to
initiate wire transfer.

## Regulation

Wire transfers are governed by Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code
and by the operating rules of the network.

Consumer payments systems tolerate a percentage of fraud losses.
The cost is covered by revenue earned on good transactions.
There's no price that is tolerable for the loss of a $500 million wire transfer.

## Economics

The Fed charges less than $1 to banks to process transactions through Fedwire.
Banks charge their customers $3 to $50.

Many transactions are "on-us"
where the sending bank and receiving bank are the same.
