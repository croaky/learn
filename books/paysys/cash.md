## Overview

The cash payments system:

* has "push" payments
* is not owned by anyone
* is governed by U.S. law and Federal Reserve Bank regulation
* economics are ATM withdrawals are subject to network interchange

Cash is in many ways the simplest payments system.
It is self-clearing.
It has no accounts or service relationships.
It is a virtual payments system: no one owns it or writes the rules for it.
It can be used anonymously by both payer and payee.

## Production

Cash is printed by
the U.S. Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing (bank notes) and
the U.S. Mint (coins).

The only way cash is inserted into the economy is
if a bank that is a Federal Reserve Bank member orders cash from the Fed.
Upon receiving the order,
the Fed debits the bank's account at the Fed for amount ordered
and tells the bank to collect the cash.

Banks then deliver the cash to their vaults at branches,
to their ATMs,
and to merchants that have put in orders for cash.
Armored car services supply the trucks and personnel for the banks.

## Acceptance

Merchants that accept cash need personnel and secure storage systems.
Costs to merchants to handle cash are largely fixed.
Reducing the percentage of cash payments is unlikely to see
a corresponding reduction in expense.

Merchants are not required by law to accept cash.
"Legal tender" is in reference to using cash to settle debt.

## Deposit

Consumers and merchants deposit cash at banks via teller or ATM.
A large cash-accepting merchant will count, wrap, and bundle cash
prior to deposit to reduce bank fees.

Grocery stores and others "recycle" cash back at point of sale
to PIN debit customers.

Banks (and some large merchants) screen currency to detect counterfeits.

Banks can deposit worn or damaged currency at the Federal Reserve Bank,
where it is destroyed.

## Developing Countries

In many developing countries, cash is the dominant form of payment.
Some research believes more than 90% of purchased in India are made with cash.
This in large part due to people being "unbanked".

Mobile wallet services in these countries such as M-Pesa in Kenya
rely on agents such as small shopkeepers
to provide "cash-in" and "cash-out" services.

## ATMs

ATMs were introduced in the 1970s and
are the most common way U.S. consumers get cash from their checking accounts.

A consumer can withdraw cash from their bank,
or from another bank which connects to their bank through the ATM network,
or from a non-bank which connects to their bank
through another bank on the ATM network.

If a customer goes to another bank's ATM to withdraw cash, there may be fees:

* ATM network interchange
* Surcharge assessed by bank supplying ATM,
  taken out of customer's account with withdrawal.
* Fee assessed by customer's bank for using "foreign" ATM,
  intended to offset interchange that bank paid
* Facility owner may be paid for hosting ATM

## Regulation and Risk

The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 and
the USA Patriot Act of 2001 created obligations on banks
to report large cash deposits
in order to reduce money laundering.

The U.S. Secret Service has law enforcement responsibility
for prevention of, and investigation of,
counterfeiting of U.S. currency.
